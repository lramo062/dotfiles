2016-12-24 12:06:20	~Christian0411	Imma use that. 
2016-12-24 12:07:35	~Christian0411	I'm gonna leave a review on the App Store. Gotta support OSS
2016-12-24 12:08:05	 lramo062	yeah im on weechat right now
2016-12-24 12:08:23	 lramo062	dude these people are tripping lol 
2016-12-24 12:08:54	 lramo062	you can create a product just fine like wtf, the only thing is that It wont appear on the user index page because there's a limit of 4
2016-12-24 12:09:12	 lramo062	beacuse that's what he told me would be the most ever in the user facing screens
2016-12-24 12:09:53	 lramo062	the only thing that is buggy is the log in bro i need to fix that because for sure he's gonna write that
2016-12-24 12:09:59	 omart725	Didn't want create me packaged disabled if there are already 4?
2016-12-24 12:10:18	 lramo062	for some reason some times i can't log in becuase it says user name does not exist
2016-12-24 12:10:18	 omart725	Sorry that was written so bad lol
2016-12-24 12:10:31	 lramo062	and oscar idk what you meant in that message
2016-12-24 12:10:45	 omart725	Didn't he say he wanted create new package disabled if there are already 4?
2016-12-24 12:11:18	 lramo062	still dont know what you mean
2016-12-24 12:12:38	 omart725	Christian: he said to disable create new package button if there are already 4
2016-12-24 12:12:49	 omart725	Didn't mean to tag Chris lol
2016-12-24 12:14:11	~Christian0411	Oh shit I gotta get slack 
2016-12-24 12:14:41	 lramo062	oh nah I never knew he said that, where did he say that?
2016-12-24 12:15:17	 omart725	In the slack. It's the latest trello update he posted 
2016-12-24 12:15:55	 omart725	Yo to install weechat you used homebrew?
2016-12-24 12:16:01	 lramo062	no but i mean i think he meant it as an issue 
2016-12-24 12:16:09	 lramo062	like he can't create it 
2016-12-24 12:16:37	 lramo062	but you can, it just doesn't display the on the user-index screen 
2016-12-24 12:16:37	~Christian0411	Very important brew install weechat --with-lua 
2016-12-24 12:16:46	 lramo062	and do --with python
2016-12-24 12:17:02	 lramo062	oscar i fixed the module issue
2016-12-24 12:17:05	 lramo062	guess what it was 
2016-12-24 12:17:39	 lramo062	i was doing pacman -S python-websocket
2016-12-24 12:18:07	 lramo062	i needed to do python2-websocket, fucking peice of shit python
2016-12-24 12:18:52	 lramo062	idk do you think this is an issue or an added feature that he wants us to add... and btw chris i can't get slack to work unless ennio enables a xmpp setting for the group
2016-12-24 12:19:24	 omart725	It is confusing the way he wrote it
2016-12-24 12:19:52	 omart725	Yeah I think it's an issue that he wants us to fix 
2016-12-24 12:20:02	 omart725	Rather than a feature
2016-12-24 12:21:41	 lramo062	well it's working 
2016-12-24 12:22:13	 lramo062	for me, it just doesn't display on the user-index beacuse there was a limit we set
2016-12-24 12:22:26	 omart725	I think he wants to be able to create more than 4
2016-12-24 12:23:48	 lramo062	yeah and just enable the ones you want but the max is going to be 4 on the user-index
2016-12-24 12:24:00	 lramo062	from what ennio told me before
2016-12-24 12:24:15	~Christian0411	Yo, Iwhats the command to join the server once in weechat
2016-12-24 12:25:30	 lramo062	you need to follow the instructions on the git repository for matrix
2016-12-24 12:25:52	~Christian0411	Im already all loaded. But it wont join
2016-12-24 12:25:56	 lramo062	to install scripts on weechat you do /script install <script-name>
2016-12-24 12:26:04	 lramo062	oh 
2016-12-24 12:26:09	 lramo062	do /buffers
2016-12-24 12:26:16	 lramo062	and see if matrix pops up 
2016-12-24 12:26:55	 lramo062	it's /buffer ***
2016-12-24 12:27:00	 lramo062	without the s 
2016-12-24 12:27:33	 lramo062	and that's like the matrix admin thing so there you would join the channels but look at the instructions on git 
2016-12-24 12:28:12	 omart725	What hit?
2016-12-24 12:28:15	 omart725	Git 
2016-12-24 12:28:30	 lramo062	github
2016-12-24 12:28:42	 omart725	Which one?
2016-12-24 12:28:48	 lramo062	https://github.com/torhve/weechat-matrix-protocol-script
2016-12-24 12:30:06	 lramo062	ima go hit the gym cause it closes at 2:00pm, I'm waiting for ennio to reply but creating a package is working... if he wants to display more than 4 in the user side or disable the create new product button when there is 4 packages already active it would be really easy
2016-12-24 12:30:18	~Christian0411	Bro, Im already loaded into matrix. How do I join this room
2016-12-24 12:30:35	 lramo062	did you add your account

2016-12-24 12:55:16	 omart725	So now on weechat, it doesn't give me the no cjson file errors. I set my user and pass and did /matrix connect. Now what?
2016-12-24 12:55:45	 omart725	I did /buffer 
2016-12-24 12:56:09	 lramo062	Ask Chris I forgot what I did after that
2016-12-24 12:56:21	~Christian0411	Yeah /buffer should show loca
2016-12-24 12:56:32	 lramo062	You set up your account on matrix?
2016-12-24 12:56:33	~Christian0411	Then just do /buffer and the number. 
2016-12-24 12:57:07	 omart725	It doesn't it just says:
2016-12-24 12:57:07		[1] core.weechat (notify:all)

2016-12-24 12:57:40	 lramo062	And then it should show the buffers with loca
2016-12-24 12:58:28	~Christian0411	Try /join !ORBhSpdCCuCXvPeCwl:matrix.org
2016-12-24 12:58:39	~Christian0411	Then do /buffer
2016-12-24 13:02:24	 omart725	It's saying my password is wrong 
2016-12-24 13:02:35	 omart725	I double checked it already though 
2016-12-24 13:02:43	 lramo062	Damn brah you a mess

2016-12-24 14:10:36	~Christian0411	Nah man. Name someone getting rich off apis. No moneyization. 
2016-12-24 14:10:50	~Christian0411	Less and less people are willing to pay for an API. 
2016-12-24 14:11:57	 lramo062	True true

2016-12-24 14:16:32	~Christian0411	Analyze player stats and choose the best players. Doesn't need to be football it could be any sport.

2016-12-24 14:48:27	 Lester	im messing around with this shit it's raw
2016-12-24 14:54:18	 Lester	chris you dont ever turn off your computer right?
2016-12-24 14:54:42	~Christian	Nope never. 
2016-12-24 14:55:26	 Lester	damn bryan was telling me that lol, he says he turns it off at night or whatever 
2016-12-24 14:55:54	 Lester	i do too, i just let it sleep during the day
2016-12-24 15:02:05	 Oscar	I never turn mine off either. Are there any side effects to not doing so?
2016-12-24 15:02:17	~Christian	Yeah he's always given me shit for that. There are NO downsides. 
2016-12-24 15:02:36	~Christian	It's a computer not a fucking person that needs sleep. 
2016-12-24 15:07:16	 Lester	I would just think like that running a system like arch if you upgrade packages you should reboot
2016-12-24 15:08:38	~Christian	Yeah but that's like after you do something. Overnight I leave that shit. 
2016-12-24 15:11:31	 Oscar	Christian: remember how when we restarted our computers, it cleared some memory. Maybe that's why you should turn it off?
2016-12-24 15:11:59	 Oscar	I probably won't do it but I'm just saying, that might be a pro
2016-12-24 15:12:00	~Christian	I would only do it if I have an issue. 
2016-12-24 15:12:08	 Oscar	Yeah same
2016-12-24 15:12:45	~Christian	Back in middle school I set my shit up to turn off at 2 am and turn on at 6 pm because that's when I had to get back to my house.

2016-12-25 16:59:25	 lramo062	yeah, like you google the football game and it directly tells you the information without going to any site

2016-12-25 18:41:12	 lramo062	what do you think i should do in terms of programming on the go 
2016-12-25 18:41:30	~Christian	Use your laptop 
2016-12-25 18:41:48	 lramo062	should i set up my computer as a server ? should I install linux on my mac? use a raspberry pi?
2016-12-25 18:46:33	~Christian	I mean since you are all terminal based you can ssh and code there but that can be slow. I would just setup like a git server or use github for all the code. 
2016-12-25 18:51:08	 lramo062	!
2016-12-25 18:53:05	 lramo062	idk but i want like the same enviorment
