2016-12-27 13:07:08	 Lester	lmao that shit is do dumb
2016-12-27 13:07:25	 Lester	so *
2016-12-27 13:15:25	 Lester	bruh what should I work on
2016-12-27 13:15:38	 Lester	i wanna do something in Java or clojure
2016-12-27 13:15:51	~Christian	Learning web assembly and compiling Haskell for it. 
2016-12-27 13:16:03	~Christian	Then make a website written in Haskell. 
2016-12-27 13:17:26	 Lester	nah im good
2016-12-27 13:17:36	 Lester	i don't wanna do that shit lmao 
2016-12-27 13:17:41	~Christian	You gotta be on the cutting edge. 
2016-12-27 13:18:17	 Lester	idk F# and haskell are cool but i enjoy doing lisp or clojure
2016-12-27 13:18:39	~Christian	Do GPU parallelization with clojure. 
2016-12-27 13:20:16	 Lester	idk i have to learn OpenCL, but there aren't any examples online 
2016-12-27 13:21:01	 Lester	the only thing is that openCL is like the same in every language so if i learn it in java i can use the same functions in clojure or what ever language
2016-12-28 16:19:21	 Lester	nah boi it's all about that 2K 
2016-12-28 16:19:37	 Lester	yeo
2016-12-28 16:23:53	 Lester	how do you scroll up on weechat?
2016-12-29 12:59:04	 Lester	finally bro, my weechat wasn't working
2016-12-29 12:59:44	 Lester	oscar i read through the script and have a few questions
2016-12-29 13:01:21	 Oscar	Dimelo
2016-12-29 13:01:36	 Oscar	Dimelo
2016-12-29 13:01:54	 Lester	so since you have the script running on weechat, does the script actually wait for weechat to send it the message or does the script prompt the weechat program every second or something for new data
2016-12-29 13:02:17	 Lester	i think thats like polling or something
2016-12-29 13:02:18	~Christian	The script runs a function anytime a buffer is updated with print. 
2016-12-29 13:02:31	~Christian	It hooks into a weechat function. 
2016-12-29 13:02:58	 Lester	oh so when weechat sees that the buffer has been modified it sends that data to the script
2016-12-29 13:03:25	~Christian	Yes in a way. 
2016-12-29 13:03:49	 Lester	okay, was this a weechat api thing
2016-12-29 13:03:58	 Lester	like weechat has a built in api for that?
2016-12-29 13:04:23	 Oscar	Yeah
2016-12-29 13:05:25	 Lester	in linux i was researching that i have to use libnotify to get desktop notifcations working with GTK or QT graphics
2016-12-29 13:05:50	~Christian	To modify the script to work on Linux would be very very simple
2016-12-29 13:06:08	~Christian	Just change the method of notification and use the same code. 
2016-12-29 13:06:22	 Lester	i'm gonna edit my i3 config to start a weechat terminal in another workspace (theres' 9) and try to work with your script to make it work for linux
2016-12-29 13:06:32	 Lester	is it okay if i fork 
2016-12-29 13:06:42	~Christian	The reason is terminal-notifier is a mac thing. To make it cross compatible we would need to use a different notification system. 
2016-12-29 13:06:56	 Lester	Christian
2016-12-29 13:07:07	 Lester	how do I mention you so it's red ?
2016-12-29 13:07:11	 Lester	with @?
2016-12-29 13:07:19	~Christian	You just did
2016-12-29 13:08:03	 Lester	oh okay... well i was gonna tell you that my script is fetching fantasy point leaders for NBA players lol
2016-12-29 13:08:35	 Lester	some machine learning guy who has a ton of python projects stared my project, he strictly does machine learning for sports i think
2016-12-29 13:09:08	 Lester	oh i see the terminal notifier on the script
2016-12-29 13:09:33	~Christian	Probably one of those guys that makes money from it. My bro was telling me the top fantasy sports people are all using bots. 
2016-12-29 13:09:56	 Lester	Let me look up his page
2016-12-29 13:11:19	 Lester	https://github.com/christopherjenness
2016-12-29 14:59:44	 Lester	nvm i got it working !!
2016-12-29 15:00:11	 Lester	yo!! some one stared my project again for emacs and i was snooping on his ass
2016-12-29 15:00:36	 Lester	and they contribute to a raw ass emacs plugin that displays a dashboard on startup
2016-12-29 15:00:40	 Oscar	Aye! What did you find out about them?
2016-12-29 15:01:13	 Lester	like on startup ot can display what ever you want, recent files, run a script and output it to the dashboard etc..
2016-12-29 15:01:30	 Lester	look at how they have nba scores on their dashboard
2016-12-29 15:01:37	 Lester	https://github.com/qorrect/emacs-dashboard-nba
2016-12-29 15:03:48	 Lester	this nigga snapped
2016-12-29 15:04:31	 Lester	im gonna try to run his code and see what's going on after, but yoo now that I got the notification running 
2016-12-29 15:04:37	 Lester	what would i have to edit on your script
2016-12-29 15:05:10	 Oscar	What do you mean?
2016-12-29 15:05:38	 Oscar	Oh you got notifications working independent of the script
2016-12-29 15:06:06	 Lester	so instead of terminal notifier i have another tool to get me the notifications running
2016-12-29 15:06:09	 Lester	yeah 
2016-12-29 15:06:37	 Lester	so to call it from terminal it would be for me "notify-send <message goes here>"
2016-12-29 15:07:07	 Lester	ahh i see
2016-12-29 15:07:50	 Oscar	The function to make the notification is only called once, at the bottom. The code above it is to determine when not to send a notification
2016-12-29 15:08:25	 Lester	i see, i'm gonna have to see my notification options because you have title, subtitle and message
2016-12-29 15:08:25	 Oscar	So just replace the function call to notify that's at the bottom with whatever you need 
2016-12-29 15:12:10	 Lester	okay i think i got it
2016-12-29 15:12:33	 Lester	i can't believe im editing a python file
2016-12-29 15:12:45	 Oscar	It's beautiful right
2016-12-29 15:12:53	 Oscar	Such a crisp language
2016-12-29 15:12:55	 Oscar	so much power
2016-12-29 15:14:08	 Lester	what's the format function?
2016-12-29 15:15:10	 Oscar	What format function?
2016-12-29 15:15:18	 Lester	.format()
2016-12-29 15:15:52	 Oscar	Oh, thats just something terminal-notifier uses to format the notification
2016-12-29 15:15:59	 Oscar	You shouldnt need any of that code
2016-12-29 15:16:06	 Oscar	Since youre using something else
2016-12-29 15:19:24	 Lester	okay send me something
2016-12-29 15:19:32	 Oscar	something
2016-12-29 15:21:43	 Lester	test
2016-12-29 15:22:09	 Lester	send it again
2016-12-29 15:22:21	 Lester	my bad i fucked up something but the rest works
2016-12-29 15:22:34	 Oscar	So it's working?
2016-12-29 15:22:45	 Lester	yeah
2016-12-29 15:23:05	 Lester	it works but it's not displaying the message right im fucking up the formatting
2016-12-29 15:25:02	 Lester	keep messaging me
2016-12-29 15:25:57	 Lester	someone

2016-12-29 15:29:23	 Lester	That's what I want to do that I run this command
2016-12-29 15:30:06	 Lester	notify-send "Weechat\n" "Oscar\n my message"
2016-12-29 15:30:31	 Lester	os.system('notify-send "' + title + '\n" ' + '"' + subtitle + '\n' + message + '"')
2016-12-29 15:30:45	 Lester	so thats how i have it but it says im missing a "
2016-12-29 15:33:02	 Oscar	You're trying to have python run that command from the terminal?
2016-12-29 15:34:09	 Lester	well thats how the command is from terminal so from the python file i ran that snippet i sent you where it said os.system fdfdsfsfsdf
2016-12-29 15:35:25	 Lester	send something again i think i got it
2016-12-29 15:35:36	 Lester	cause before it was just saying oscar, not the message

2016-12-29 15:39:59	 Oscar	which ones?
2016-12-29 15:40:57	 Oscar	Title is the largest and is above in bold, subtitle is under title, and message is at the bottom and holds the message you want to send
2016-12-29 15:41:12	 Oscar	for us, title is sender name, subtitle is buffer name and message is message sent
2016-12-29 15:42:03	 Lester	okay so title is like the person ?
2016-12-29 15:42:11	 Lester	subtitle is the chat name
2016-12-29 15:42:16	 Lester	and message is the message
2016-12-29 15:42:24	 Oscar	Exactlu
2016-12-29 15:42:27	 Oscar	Exactly*
2016-12-29 15:44:10	 Lester	okay i still get an erorr 
2016-12-29 15:44:15	 Lester	with the end of file parsing
2016-12-29 15:45:01	 Lester	i think it's beacuse im doing something like this '"included a double quote' + '" end double quote'
2016-12-29 15:45:10	 Lester	can that throw an error in python?
2016-12-29 15:46:09	 Oscar	yeah do try: except:
2016-12-29 15:47:49	 Oscar	then raise Errorname()
2016-12-29 15:47:54	 Oscar	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2052390/manually-raising-throwing-an-exception-in-python
2016-12-29 15:50:39	 Lester	okay send another message, i'm using the formatter

2016-12-29 15:51:55	 Lester	okay nah dude it's something else idk why it's throwing the mismatching "
2016-12-29 15:56:19	 Oscar	Idk, you could try running the command directly to the terminal through python. For my wallpaper script, I run all the git commands to update the webpage with the new picture
2016-12-29 15:56:49	 Lester	idk 
2016-12-29 15:57:22	 Lester	That's what I got

2016-12-29 16:36:51	 Oscar	I told you
2016-12-29 16:36:53	 Lester	and used call and just passed it my parameters
2016-12-29 16:37:15	 Oscar	When making a call to the terminal directly, you need to use call
2016-12-29 16:37:42	 Oscar	Starting beef with python for no reason
2016-12-29 16:37:51	 Lester	nah brah we still got beef
2016-12-29 16:38:00	 Lester	that shit isn't settled just yet
2016-12-29 16:39:05	 Lester	python is just like sabina 
2016-12-29 16:39:36	 Lester	where as lisp is like adam, it never bothers you, you don't even know its there

2016-12-29 16:47:06	 Lester	idk how it works like do i fork it and make it an i3notification script thingy
2016-12-29 16:47:08	 Lester	idk
2016-12-29 16:48:05	 Oscar	I think so
2016-12-29 16:49:19	 Lester	alright im gonna post the script and give you credit and then im gonna include like the extra configuration for the notify-send because it needs it's own config gile
2016-12-29 16:49:23	 Lester	file*
2016-12-29 16:49:53	 Oscar	Don't forget to give Chris credit too
2016-12-29 16:50:06	 Lester	fuck that nigga
2016-12-29 16:50:56	 Oscar	Lmao, he figured out the key function to make the whole thing work
